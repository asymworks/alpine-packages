# Asymworks Alpine Packages

Contains customized Alpine Linux packages for Asymworks devices. Packages are pegged to Alpine releases to avoid needing to pull packages from `edge`, as well as including some customizations. Also all packages are built for `armhf` and `armv7` to support installation on Raspberry Pi Model 3B+ and above.
