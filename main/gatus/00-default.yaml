# Gatus Default Configuration File
#
# Gatus will read all files in the /etc/gatus.d directory in file name order,
# and merge the YAML structure from each. This file contains the top level
# configuration for Gatus and expects that endpoints and notifications are
# set up in subsequent files.

# Storage Configuration
#
# This sets up storage in memory, which is the default. To persist monitoring
# data, use either the `sqlite` or `postgres` storage backend.

  type: memory
  maximum-number-of-results: 200
